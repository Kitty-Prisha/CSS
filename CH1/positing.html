        Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of 11 players on an oval-shaped field, with the aim of scoring
        more runs than the opposing team by batting and fielding. The game revolves around a rectangular pitch with wickets
        (three stumps with bails) at each end, where batsmen try to score runs by hitting the ball and running between the
        wickets.
